1. **`/app`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser).

2. **`.babelrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) Babel is mainly used to convert ECMAScript code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

3. **`.eslintrc`**: This is a configuration file for [EsLint](https://eslint.org/). Eslint is a tool to help developers discover problems with their JavaScript code without executing it.

4. **`.gitlab-ci.yml`**: This is a configuration file for the GitLab pipelines and our build process.

5. **`.stylelintrc`**: This is a configuration file for [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io/) StyleLint is a linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your css styles.

6. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

7. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8. **`yarn.lock`** This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
